FileIO aims to provide a common framework for detecting file formats
and dispatching to appropriate readers/writers.  The two core
functions in this package are called `load` and `save`, and offer
high-level support for formatted files (in contrast with julia's
low-level `read` and `write`).  To avoid name conflicts, packages that
provide support for standard file formats through functions named
`load` and `save` are encouraged to extend the definitions here.
[Supported Files](docs/registry.md)

## Installation

Install FileIO via `Pkg.add("FileIO")`.

## Usage

If your format has been registered, it might be as simple as
```jl
using FileIO
obj = load(filename)
```
to read data from a formatted file.  Likewise, saving might be as simple as
```
save(filename, obj)
```

If you just want to inspect a file to determine its format, then
```jl
file = query(filename)
s = query(io)   # io is a stream
```
will return a `File` or `Stream` object that also encodes the detected
file format.

Sometimes you want to read or write files that are larger than your available
memory, or might be an unknown or infinite length (e.g. reading an audio or
video stream from a socket). In these cases it might not make sense to process
the whole file at once, but instead process it a chunk at a time. For these situations FileIO provides the `loadstreaming` and `savestreaming` functions, which return an object that you can `read` or `write`, rather than the file data itself.

This would look something like:

```jl
using FileIO
audio = loadstreaming("bigfile.wav")
try
    while !eof(audio)
        chunk = read(audio, 4096) # read 4096 frames
        # process the chunk
    end
finally
    close(stream)
end
```

or use `do` syntax to auto-close the stream:

```jl
using FileIO
do loadstreaming("bigfile.wav") audio
    while !eof(audio)
        chunk = read(audio, 4096) # read 4096 frames
        # process the chunk
    end
end
```

Note that in these cases you may want to use `read!` with a pre-allocated buffer for maximum efficiency.

## Adding new formats

You register a new format by adding `add_format(fmt, magic,
extension)` to the [registry](https://github.com/JuliaIO/FileIO.jl/blob/master/src/registry.jl). To do so, please just open a pull request (you can just edit the file in Github).
`fmt` is a `DataFormat` type, most conveniently created
as `format"IDENTIFIER"`.  `magic` typically contains the magic bytes
that identify the format.  Here are some examples:

```jl
# A straightforward format
add_format(format"PNG", [0x89,0x50,0x4e,0x47,0x0d,0x0a,0x1a,0x0a], ".png")

# A format that uses only ASCII characters in its magic bytes, and can
# have one of two possible file extensions
add_format(format"NRRD", "NRRD", [".nrrd",".nhdr"])

# A format whose magic bytes might not be at the beginning of the file,
# necessitating a custom function `detecthdf5` to find them
add_format(format"HDF5", detecthdf5, [".h5", ".hdf5"])

# A fictitious format that, unfortunately, provides no magic
# bytes. Here we have to place our faith in the file extension.
add_format(format"DICEY", (), ".dcy")
```

You can also declare that certain formats require certain packages for
I/O support:

```jl
add_loader(format"HDF5", :HDF5)
add_saver(format"PNG", :ImageMagick)
```
These packages will be automatically loaded as needed.
You can also define the loaders and savers in a short form like this:
```jl
add_format(format"OFF", "OFF", ".off", [:MeshIO])
```
This means MeshIO supports loading and saving of the `off` format.
You can add multiple loaders and specifiers like this:
```jl
add_format(
    format"BMP",
    UInt8[0x42,0x4d],
    ".bmp",
    [:OSXNativeIO, LOAD, OSX],
    [:ImageMagick]
)
```
This means, OSXNative has first priority (gets loaded first) and only supports loading `bmp` on `OSX`.
So on windows, `OSXNativeIO` will be ignored and `ImageMagick` has first priority.
You can add any combination of `LOAD`, `SAVE`, `OSX`, `Unix`, `Windows` and `Linux`.

Users are encouraged to contribute these definitions to the
`registry.jl` file of this package, so that information about file
formats exists in a centralized location.

## Implementing loaders/savers

In your package, write code like the following:

```jl
using FileIO

function load(f::File{format"PNG"})
    open(f) do s
        skipmagic(s)  # skip over the magic bytes
        # You can just call the method below...
        ret = load(s)
        # ...or implement everything here instead
    end
end

# You can support streams and add keywords:
function load(s::Stream{format"PNG"}; keywords...)
    # s is already positioned after the magic bytes
    # Do the stuff to read a PNG file
    chunklength = read(s, UInt32)
    ...
end

function save(f::File{format"PNG"}, data)
    open(f, "w") do s
        # Don't forget to write the magic bytes!
        write(s, magic(format"PNG"))
        # Do the rest of the stuff needed to save in PNG format
    end
end
```

Note that `load(::File)` and `save(::File)` should close any streams
they open.  (If you use the `do` syntax, this happens for you
automatically even if the code inside the `do` scope throws an error.)
Conversely, `load(::Stream)` and `save(::Stream)` should not close the
input stream.

`loadstreaming` and `savestreaming` use the same query mechanism, but return a decoded stream that users can `read` or `write`. You should also implement a `close` method on your reader or writer type. Just like with `load` and `save`, if the user provided a filename, your `close` method should be responsible for closing any streams you opened in order to read or write the file. If you are given a `Stream`, your `close` method should only do the clean up for your reader or writer type, not close the stream.

```julia
struct WAVReader
    io::IO
    ownstream::Bool
end

function read(reader::WAVReader, frames::Int)
    # read and decode audio samples from reader.io
end

function close(reader::WAVReader)
    # do whatever cleanup the reader needs
    if reader.ownstream
        close(reader.io)
    end
end
loadstreaming(f::File{format"WAV"}) = WAVReader(open(f), ownstream=true)
loadstreaming(s::Stream{format"WAV"}) = WAVReader(s, ownstream=false)
# FileIO has fallback functions that make these work using `do` syntax as well.
```

If you choose to implement `loadstreaming` and `savestreaming` in your package,
you can easily add `save` and `load` methods in the form of:

```julia
function save(q::Formatted{format"WAV"}, data, args...; kwargs...)
    savestreaming(args...; kwargs...) do stream
        write(stream, data)
    end
end

function load(q::Formatted{format"WAV"}, args...; kwargs...)
    savestreaming(args...; kwargs...) do stream
        readall(stream)
    end
end
```

## Help

You can get an API overview by typing `?FileIO` at the REPL prompt.
Individual functions have their own help too, e.g., `?add_format`.
